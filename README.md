# Analogues of the 2016 crop failure in northern France

Scripts used to produce the results of "Simulating compound weather extremes responsible for critical cropfailure with stochastic weather generators" by Pfleiderer et al.

## Requirements

Running the analysis requires an installation of R with the following libraries: parallel, ncdf4, fields, maps.

## Documentation

The analysis of December temperatures and April-July precipitation can be performed individually.

Reanalysis data (from NCEP) and gridded observations (from EOBS) have to be added into the "data" folder before running the scripts.

Analogues were computed following:
