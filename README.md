Scripts used to produce the results of "Simulating compound weather extremes responsible for critical cropfailure with stochastic weather generators" by Pfleiderer et al.

## Requirements

Running the analysis requires an installation of R with the following libraries: parallel, ncdf4, fields, maps.

## Documentation

The analysis of December temperatures and April-July precipitation can be performed individually.

Analogues were computed with the tool developped by lsce? (https://birdy.lsce.ipsl.fr:8443/)
